Bash version is to be at least 4.0 (associative arrays were added in version
4.0 of bash).

Utility to compute checksum is provided with npsync. It should be built with C
compiler:

> gcc -O6 -Wall adler32.c -o adler32 -lz

Run npsync with option -h to list available storage interfaces.
Paths to `adler32' and storage utilities should be tuned manually in npsync for
installation if required:

  * Paths to general-purpose utilities are assigned in section `# common utilities' of npsync.

  * Paths to storage utilities are assigned in subsection `#----------------- utilities' in storage specific sections of npsync:

    * `# POSIX storage interface' -- POSIX FS

    * `# CASTOR storage interface' -- CASTOR HSM system

An interface to a storage can be implemented as a file. Paths to interface
files are to be pointed with option --npsync-interface or with environment
variable NPS_INTERFACE_FILES as a colon-separated list.
For the sake of security the option is to be removed from argument list
and the environment variable is to be unset before run in a non-trusted
environment. As a prohibitive way processing of the option and the environment
variable can be commented out in the utility.
